# AiHeartDiseaseEvaluator
> Using machine learning to train & compare different AI models for heart disease evaluation task

## About
`Python 3.12` <br/>
`Made using Scikit-Learn` <br/>

This project was made by Sira Tongsima with the idea from my friend Putthakun's Senior Project. This is by no means a copy but mearly a recreation to learn how to use machine learning. Don't expect it to be highly optimized I used a lot of chatgpt for this.

## Algorithms 
This project contains 2 Algorithms which are `Logistical Regression` and `Decision Tree`. <br/>
